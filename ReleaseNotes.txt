Release Notes:

Version 0.2:
	Added v7-appcompat library to support API versions > 2.1
	Revised AndroidManifest.xml to specify parent Activities via meta-data
	Modified several layout files to change textPositionStart/End to textPositionLeft/Right
		for backwards compatibility
	Moved calls to setHasOptionsMenu to end of onCreateView since this apparently triggers
		immediate create of options menus in older releases, causing problems when
		onCreateOptionsMenu makes assumptions about what has been constructed. This fixes
		a crash when viewing the card deck in 4.1 and older.
	Added version info to preferences	
		
Version 0.1:
	Release to Casey
